**CEVINEDIT**
================
**CEViNEdit** (*Enabling Cognitive Effectiveness in the Visual Notation of Graphic Editors*) is a Model-Driven proposal to generate graphical editors that support the Domain Specific Languages. This proposal presents a development environment that allows to make GMF annotations at a high level of abstraction. Besides, the tool allows to take into account certain design decisions in order to obtain effective graphical symbols on a cognitive level.

**CEViNEdit** leans on the capabilities of [EMF](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) and [GMF](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/gmp/) for the production of DSL toolkits and the enhancement in automation that [EuGENia](http://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/eugenia/) brings to the model-driven development process of GMF-based editors.
